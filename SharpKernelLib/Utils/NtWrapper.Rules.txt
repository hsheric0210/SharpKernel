1. Do not expose unsafe types outside the NtWrapper.cs
  * Accepting or returning unsafe types from the utility methods is not allowed.
  * Especially: void*

2. Do not expose Windows.Win32, Windows.Wdk types, structs, enums outside the NtWrapper.cs
  * Accepting or returning internal types from the utility method is not allowed.
  * Especially: HANDLE, UNICODE_STRING

3. Prefer signed types over unsigned types (except UIntPtr)
  * uint -> int
  * ulong -> long
  * This only apply for those 'actually used as signed though typed as unsigned' things. (e.g. 'startIndex, bufferSize, length' parameters)

4. Return the result value by return type. Do not use 'out' or 'ref' parameters unless you need to return multiple values.

5. Always throw an exception if any errors occurred. Returning bool(success or fail), NTSTATUS(error status code) is not recommended.

6. Prefer using pointers inside the utility functions rather than 'GCHandle.Alloc' or 'Marshal.AllocHGlobal'.
